//! Trait for defining item processing pipelines in `spider-pipeline`.
//!
//! This module provides the `Pipeline` trait, which is a fundamental abstraction
//! for post-processing `ScrapedItem`s after they have been extracted by a spider.
//! Pipelines allow for a modular approach to handling scraped data, enabling
//! operations such as:
//! - Storing items in databases or files.
//! - Validating and cleaning data.
//! - Deduplicating entries.
//! - Performing further transformations.
//!
//! Implementors of this trait define the `process_item` method, which receives
//! a `ScrapedItem` and can modify, drop, or pass it along the pipeline.
//! Pipelines also support state management for checkpointing and cleanup operations.
